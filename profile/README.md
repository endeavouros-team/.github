Create your own destiny with an incredible journey

If you like to roll up your sleeves and go on an adventure, then you might want to give us a try. EndeavourOS isn’t an expressway to a predefined destination in computing, it is all about the journey towards your own destination and on top of that, you’ll be meeting new and friendly faces during that exploration. Or more appropriate, your new Endeavour.

We provide you with the opportunity to discover the flexible possibilities an Arch-based distro can give you, a user-friendly installer that gives you the option to install the system with an offline install, having a minimal but attractive looking Xfce desktop environment, and an online install option with ten different flavours in a basic and customizable look to choose from.

It doesn’t matter which option or flavour you choose, they all offer the same powerful jumpstart to begin your exciting journey towards your own destination in computing. All options have the basics like sound, network, graphics, Yay, a terminal operated AUR helper and the browser Firefox already onboard. This is the perfect start in creating your own personal computing experience, custom-made by you.

Our very own Welcome app is the first gateway to assist you on your journey. It is equipped with some very helpful tools you even want to use after you have reached your destination. That together with our wiki, a well-organized knowledge base, will allow you to build your confidence during your exploration.

But that’s not all. Our most powerful feature is not an app or automation. It is a warm, vibrant, friendly, living and breathing resource with the incredible power to boost up your enthusiasm during your journey… Our stellar community. It doesn’t matter if you are having trouble finding the right printer driver or your system doesn’t do what you want it to do. Please don’t hesitate to ask for help on our forum, Telegram or Reddit subpage. There are always friendly faces to guide you in the right direction.
