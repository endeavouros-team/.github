**Create your own destiny with an incredible journey**

If you like to roll up your sleeves and go on an adventure, then you might want to give us a try. EndeavourOS isn’t an expressway to a predefined destination in computing, it is all about the journey towards your own destination and on top of that, you’ll be meeting new and friendly faces during that exploration. Or more appropriate, your new Endeavour.

<--- **[note 20 july 2025]**

# **Because of a server problem, all 3 EndavourOS websites are not available at the moment**

**we are working on it, but it can take a bit.**

**In case you are searching for Download use this for torrent:**

[Magnet Torrent ISO Download](https://www.kamprad.net/index.php/magnet-test-page/)

**if you need direct download go here:** 

[Random-mirror](https://www.endeavour.kamprad.net/mirrormagic)

[selects a mirror randomly and start downloading latest ISO]

**the issue is not effecting installation from the ISO nor any updates related to packages, only forum, wiki and default information websites!**

**we are still not able to resolve the issue, can take a bit longer. Private life went in.**
